### Classical Harmonic Oscillator
Classical Harmonic Oscillator exists in nature, for example, spring system, pendulum, etc. In short, when two masses are connected with spring and are compressed, an damping motion may be generated. For example, a mass is connected to an unmovable wall and is compressed, the mass will be oscillating around a range. At the maximum and minimum distance of wall and mass, the velocity of mass is zero. The motion is periodic and sinusoidal. 

The total energy is given as:
$E=\frac{1}{2}mu^2+\frac{1}{2}kx^2$
Where $m$ is mass; $u$ is velocity; $k$ is spring constant; $x$ is the spring length. 

### Quantum Harmonic Oscillator

One of the most common example of Quantum Harmonic Oscillator is the description of vibrations of diatomic molecules. In analogy, two molecules is connected with a spring with potential energy which depends on the quantized displacement from the equilibrium point. So, the energy levels are quantized. It seems similar to Classical Harmonic Oscillator. The biggest difference from quantum oscillator is the when the molecules are in equilibrium point, the zero-point vibration exists and the molecules are still moving even though the system temperature is absolute zero state. Hence, the quantum oscillator is never stop. 

When the energy level are in zero-point vibration, it is called energy spacing, aka, Planck’s energy quantum. 

The time-independent Schrӧdinger equation of Quantum Oscillator system is given as:
$-\dfrac{\hslash^2}{2m} \, \dfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 \psi(x)}{\mathrm{d} x^2}+\frac{1}{2}m\omega^2u^2\psi(x)=E\psi(x)$

The discrete energy levels $E_n$ is given as:

$E_n = \hslash\omega(n+\frac{1}{2})$

Where $\hslash$ is the Planck constant; $\omega$ is the (classical) angular frequency; $n$ is an integer and bigger (equal) than (to) zero.
